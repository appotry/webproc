## Configuration

The CLI interface only exposes a subset of the configuration, to further customize
webproc, create a `program.toml` file and then load it with:

```
webproc program.toml
```

Here is a complete configuration with the defaults, only `ProgramArgs` is **required**:

[embedmd]:# (default.toml)
```toml
# Program to execute (with optional Arguments). Note: the process
# must remain in the foreground (i.e. do NOT fork/run as daemon).
# example: ["/usr/bin/dnsmasq","-config","/etc/dnsmasq.conf"]
ProgramArgs = []

# Interface to serve web UI. Warning: defaults to ALL interfaces.
Host = "0.0.0.0"

# Port to serve web UI
Port = 8080

# Basic authentication settings for web UI
User = ""
Pass = ""

# IP addresses which should be allowed to access the web UI
# For example, ["10.0.0.0/8"]
AllowedIPs = []

# Log settings for the process:
# "both" - log to both, webproc standard out/error and to the web UI log.
# "webui" - only log to the web UI. Note, the web UI only keeps the last 10k lines.
# "proxy" - only log to webproc standard out/error.
Log = "both"

# OnExit dictates what action to take when the process exits:
# "ignore" - ignore and wait for manual restart via the web UI
# "proxy" - also exit webproc with the same exit code
# "restart" - automatically restart with exponential backoff time delay between failed restarts
OnExit = "ignore"

# OnSave dictates what action to take when saving a configuration file via the UI:
# "restart" - instantly restart the process
# "continue" - do not restart the process (restart button must be used)
OnSave = "restart"

# Configuration files to be editable by the web UI.
# For example, dnsmasq would include "/etc/dnsmasq.conf"
ConfigurationFiles = []

# After the restart signal (SIGINT) has been sent, webproc will wait for RestartTimeout before
# forcibly restarting the process (SIGKILL).
RestartTimeout = "30s"
```
